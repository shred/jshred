CHANGELOG -- $Id: changelog 75 2006-02-10 08:17:27Z shred $



  * Switched to Subversion
  * Added junit to the project, so there are no Eclipse SDK dependency
    issues any more.
  * Forgot some serialVersionUIDs.

R12 (2005-12-27)
  * NOTE: R12 is the last release that is JDK1.3 compatible. Starting from
    R13, at least JDK1.4 will be required.
  * Reduced memory consumption of JIntegerFilter.
  * JHistoryTextField will not trigger an event if a selection was made from
    the combobox or the component just lost the focus.
  * BUGFIX: JToolbarButton uses setContentAreaFilled() instead of
    setOpaque() like it is required in the JDK docs.
  * SwingUtils' setMenuKey() now only sets correct mnemonics.
  * BUGFIX: JImageViewer was only usable in Java5.
  * BUGFIX: If a JSortedTable model was changed, it was shown in the model
    sequence, even though it was internally thought as sorted by a column.
  * BUGFIX: JCollapsiblePanel didn't revalidate the GUI, thus on collapse
    only the content was hidden, but no space was given free.
  * JCollapsiblePanel now remembers the collapse state optionally. Requires
    JDK1.4 or later.
  * Offered a way to add weak listener references.
  * Added ArrowIcon class which can be used to paint small arrows.

R11 (2005-04-04)
  * NOTE: R11 was not released to the public
  * JSortedTable now keeps the selection if SortableTableModelProxy is used.
  * SwingUtils.spreadColumns() will keep a minimum size of 0 for Boolean
    columns.

R10 (2005-02-09)
  * The JLAFSelector now recognizes JGoodies LAF if available.
  * JRememberOptionPane now has a function to forget multiple keys.
  * BUGFIX: Accidentally the library was compiled against JDK1.5 only.
    Ooops... :)

R9 (2005-01-27)
  * Added JCollapsiblePane.
  * Added serial UIDs where necessary.
  * Added JImageViewer.
  * BUGFIX: forgot some Graphics.dispose().
  * JPrintPreview can now be dragged with the mouse inside a JScrollPane.
  * Added JScrollableImageViewer, which implements the Scrollable interface.

R8 (2004-12-05)
  * Added JHeadline.
  * BUGFIX: JToolbarButton was opaque, which looked strange on some
    Look and Feels.
  * Added convenience methods to copy Strings to and paste Strings from
    the system's default clipboard.
  * Added JPrintPreview class which can be used to preview Printables.
  * Added JToolbarButton constructors for empty and icon buttons.
  * Added JLAFSelector class which allows to select a LAF.

R7 (2004-09-27)
  * Switched from JEdit to Eclipse. Findbugs is used as Eclipse plugin.
  * JRememberOptionPane added.
  * SortedList added.
  * EmptyListModel and EmptyTreeModel added.
  * Fixed some Findbugs reports.
  * SwingUtils: adding confirm and cancel buttons to JDialogs.
  * Added a jUnit test, more will follow. The jUnit test case classes
    are not part of the jshred.jar. Anyhow you have to copy junit.jar
    to your ant lib directory for compilation.

R6 (2004-08-18)
  * NoListSelectionModel added.
  * JHistoryTextField added.
  * XMLWriter got convenience methods for adding parameters to an
    element.
  * XMLWriter now writes much shorter and more readable XML.

R5 (2004-07-20)
  * Added findbugs config file.
  * Findbugs found an unused variable in BrightFilter, now removed.
  * JLabelGroup allows to override the label constructor, and offers
    a method to read the label component.
  * @since now used in JavaDoc.
  * Checked the Serializable state of all classes.

R4 (2004-07-15)
  * SwingUtils.spreadColumns() now also supports a minimum cell width
  * HTTPRequest now correctly sends UTF-8 encoded requests (as proposed
    by W3C) instead of using the local encoding.
  * HTTPRequest: getContentReader() now correctly handles the server's
    content encoding. getReader() is deprecated from now on.
  * HTTPRequest: added method to query result content charset
  * JSortedTable: added method to sort a column

R3 (2004-06-27)
  * MenuActionProxy now does not scale icon if its size is already
    correct.
  * Added methods to the SortableTableModelProxy that allows to map row
    numbers between the master TableModel and the proxy's representation.
  * JTable only accepts SortableTableModels now. Automatically wrapping
    classic TableModels was a conceptual flaw that lead to problems of
    proper addressing of the correct rows.

R2 (2004-06-22)
  * Checked in an obsolete CSVSplitter instead of CSVLine by
    mistake. Sorry!
  * Added a JIntegerField class

R1 (2004-06-21)
  * Initial public release
  * Released under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 tri license
