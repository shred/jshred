  * Added JScrollableImageViewer, which implements the Scrollable interface.

R8 (2004-12-05)

    Look and Feels.

  * SortedList added.
  * EmptyListModel and EmptyTreeModel added.
  * Fixed some Findbugs reports.
  * SwingUtils: adding confirm and cancel buttons to JDialogs.
  * Added a jUnit test, more will follow. The jUnit test case classes
    are not part of the jshred.jar. Anyhow you have to copy junit.jar
    to your ant lib directory for compilation.

R6 (2004-08-18)
  * NoListSelectionModel added.
  * JHistoryTextField added.
  * XMLWriter got convenience methods for adding parameters to an
    element.

  * JLabelGroup allows to override the label constructor, and offers
    a method to read the label component.
  * @since now used in JavaDoc.
  * Checked the Serializable state of all classes.

R4 (2004-07-15)
  * SwingUtils.spreadColumns() now also supports a minimum cell width
  * HTTPRequest now correctly sends UTF-8 encoded requests (as proposed
    by W3C) instead of using the local encoding.
  * HTTPRequest: getContentReader() now correctly handles the server's
    content encoding. getReader() is deprecated from now on.
  * HTTPRequest: added method to query result content charset
  * JSortedTable: added method to sort a column

R3 (2004-06-27)

    correct.
  * Added methods to the SortableTableModelProxy that allows to map row
    numbers between the master TableModel and the proxy's representation.
  * JTable only accepts SortableTableModels now. Automatically wrapping
    classic TableModels was a conceptual flaw that lead to problems of
    proper addressing of the correct rows.

R2 (2004-06-22)
  * Checked in an obsolete CSVSplitter instead of CSVLine by
    mistake. Sorry!
